The data is broken up into different tasks, each having the same features that are being recorded. There is a single feature that is not under a specific task, the "Class" feature which is for P (patients with alzheimers) and H (healthy people)

We will pre-process the data by separating it out into its respective tasks and assigning each tasks a duplicated "Class" feature column for readability purposes when plotting.

We have plotted the data for each task using pairplots and correlation matrices.

This allows for easier readability and comparisons among different tasks. As for splitting the data we will have to evenly distribute the training and testing data such that there is an equal amount of patients and healthy observations in both.
